# Extrct0r
Extrct0r is a Python script that extracts phone numbers and Facebook links from a text file and writes them to another text file. It uses the colorama library to print colored text, the re library to support regular expressions, the argparse library to support argument parsing, and the concurrent.futures library to support asynchronous execution.
